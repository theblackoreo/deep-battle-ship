# 🌐 Solana On-Chain Game 🎮

Welcome to the **Solana On-Chain Game**, a fully decentralized and trustless game built on the Solana blockchain! This project demonstrates how to leverage Solana's high throughput and low latency to create engaging and interactive gaming experiences.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This game is an on-chain experience utilizing the Solana blockchain for game logic and player interactions. The smart contract (program) is written in Rust, and the game client is built using TypeScript and React. All game data and state are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

### 🎮 Features

- **Fully On-Chain Logic:** All game actions are verified and processed directly on the Solana blockchain.
- **Decentralized State Management:** No centralized server; everything is managed by smart contracts.
- **Fast and Low-Cost Transactions:** Leveraging Solana's high-performance network for smooth gameplay.
- **Player vs Player (PvP) and Single Player Modes:** Engage in competitive matches or play solo.
- **Token Rewards:** Earn SPL tokens as rewards for winning games.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solana Blockchain**: For on-chain game logic and transactions.
- **Rust**: For writing the Solana smart contract (program).
- **Anchor Framework**: For simplified development of Solana programs.
- **React**: For the front-end client application.
- **TypeScript**: For a robust and scalable codebase.
- **Phantom Wallet**: Integration for wallet-based authentication and transactions.
- **Metaplex**: For NFTs and token rewards.
